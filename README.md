# Unnamed New Project

A library to produce statistics for finding weak points in codebases. Designed after reading Your Code As A Crime Scene.

## Find weak spots in your codebase!

Bits of code that change frequently and are highly complex are usually good places to refactor.

### Complexity metrics

* Lines of code (module)
* Total indentation (module)

### Future complexity metrics

* Lines of code (function)
* Total indentation (function)

### Effort metrics

* Number of commits

## Coupling Analysis

Mine git logs to see what modules change together.

## Churn

Mine git stats to see what files have lots of added and removed lines.
